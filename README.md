## üé® Features

- **`sprocket analyzer`** runs Sprocket as a LSP server, which is useful for IDE integration.
- **`sprocket check`** performs static analysis on a document or directory of documents.
- **`sprocket completions`** generates shell completions for Sprocket.
- **`sprocket config`** prints configuration values.
- **`sprocket dev`** subcommand containing developmental and experimental commands.
- **`sprocket explain`** explains validation and lint rules supported by Sprocket.
- **`sprocket format`** formats a document or directory of documents.
- **`sprocket inputs`** writes template input file (JSON or YAML) for a task or workflow.
- **`sprocket lint`** performs static analysis on a document or directory of documents with additional linting rules enabled (effectively a shortcut for `check --lint`).
- **`sprocket run`** runs a task or workflow.
- **`sprocket validate`** validates a set of inputs read from files or on the command line against a task or workflow.

## Guiding Principles

The following are high-level guiding principles of the Sprocket project.

- Provide a **high-performance** workflow execution engine capable of
  orchestrating massive bioinformatics workloads (the stated target is 20,000+
  concurrent jobs).
- Develop a suite of **modern development tools** that brings bioinformatics
  development on par with other modern languages (e.g.,
  [`wdl-lsp`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/tree/main/wdl-lsp)).
- Maintain an **community-focused codebase** that enables a diverse set of
  contributors from academic, non-profit, and commercial organizations.
- Build on an **open, domain-tailored standard** to ensure the toolset remains
  singularly focused on unencumbered innovation within bioinformatics.
- Retain a **simple and accessible user experience** when complexity isn't warranted.

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

Check the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/releases)
to see if Sprocket is available for your platform.

Note that the prebuilt Sprocket for Linux may not work on every distribution
due to library dependencies.

If Sprocket is not available for your platform or architecture, you may install
it with `cargo` from a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain.

We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install a Rust toolchain.

Once Rust is installed, you can install the latest version of Sprocket by
running the following command:

```bash
cargo install sprocket --locked
```

### Homebrew

Sprocket is also available on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for both MacOS and Linux. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Sprocket with the following command.

```bash
brew install sprocket
```

### Docker

Sprocket is available as a Docker [image](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pkgs/container/sprocket).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket:v0.17.0
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

To bootstrap a development environment, please use the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:stjude-rust-labs/sprocket.git
cd sprocket

# Initialize and update vendored submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the crate in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run the `sprocket` command line tool
cargo run --release
```

## üößÔ∏è Tests

Before submitting any pull requests, please make sure the code passes the
following checks (from the root directory).

```bash
# Run the project's tests.
cargo test --all-features

# Run the tests for the examples.
cargo test --examples --all-features

# Ensure the project doesn't have any linting warnings.
cargo clippy --all-features

# Ensure the project passes `cargo fmt`.
cargo fmt --check

# Ensure the docs build.
cargo doc
```
