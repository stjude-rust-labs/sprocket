## üé® Features

- **`sprocket analyzer`** runs Sprocket as a LSP server, which is useful for IDE integration.
- **`sprocket check`** performs static analysis on a document or directory of documents.
- **`sprocket explain`** explains validation and lint rules supported by Sprocket.
- **`sprocket format`** formats a document.
- **`sprocket lint`** performs static analysis on a document or directory of documents with additional linting rules enabled (effectively a shortcut for `check --lint`).
- **`sprocket run`** runs a task or workflow.
- **`sprocket validate`** validates a set of inputs read from files or on the command line against a task or workflow.
- **`sprocket completions`** generates shell completions for Sprocket.

## Guiding Principles

The following are high-level guiding principles of the Sprocket project.

- Provide a **high-performance** workflow execution engine capable of
  orchestrating massive bioinformatics workloads (the stated target is 20,000+
  concurrent jobs).
- Develop a suite of **modern development tools** that brings bioinformatics
  development on par with other modern languages (e.g.,
  [`wdl-lsp`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/tree/main/wdl-lsp)).
- Maintain an **community-focused codebase** that enables a diverse set of
  contributors from academic, non-profit, and commercial organizations.
- Build on an **open, domain-tailored standard** to ensure the toolset remains
  singularly focused on unencumbered innovation within bioinformatics.
- Retain a **simple and accessible user experience** when complexity isn't warranted.

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

Before you can install `sprocket`, you'll need to install
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to accomplish this. Once Rust is installed, you can install the latest version of `sprocket` by
running the following command.

```bash
cargo install sprocket
```

### Docker

Sprocket is available as a Docker [image](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pkgs/container/sprocket).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket:v0.12.2
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

To bootstrap a development environment, please use the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:stjude-rust-labs/sprocket.git
cd sprocket

# Build the crate in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run the `sprocket` command line tool
cargo run --release
```

## üößÔ∏è Tests

Before submitting any pull requests, please make sure the code passes the
following checks (from the root directory).

```bash
# Run the project's tests.
cargo test --all-features

# Run the tests for the examples.
cargo test --examples --all-features

# Ensure the project doesn't have any linting warnings.
cargo clippy --all-features

# Ensure the project passes `cargo fmt`.
cargo fmt --check

# Ensure the docs build.
cargo doc
```
