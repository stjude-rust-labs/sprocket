   = fix: include an entry for the `container` key in the `runtime` section

warning[RuntimeSectionKeys]: the following runtime keys are not reserved in the WDL 1.1 specification: `baz` and `foo`; therefore, their inclusion in the `runtime` section is deprecated

14 │         baz: "quux"
   │         --- the `baz` key should be removed

   = fix: if reserved key names were intended, correct the spelling of each key; otherwise, remove the `baz` and `foo` keys
