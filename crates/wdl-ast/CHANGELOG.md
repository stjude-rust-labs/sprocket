## 0.14.0 - 07-09-2025

## 0.13.0 - 05-27-2025

#### Fixed

* If a WDL >=v1.2 workflow has a non-boolean value for the "allow nested inputs" hint, the metadata will also be

  strings and provided unescaping of escape sequences ([#265](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/265)).

* Specified the MSRV for the crate ([#144](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/144)).
* Add `as_*()` and `into_*()` methods for each enum item in `Expr` and `LiteralExpr`
  ([#142](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/142)).
* Add parsing of `container` elements within `runtime` and `requirements` blocks
  according to the [current version of the WDL
  specification](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/wdl-1.2/SPEC.md#container)
  ([#142](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/142)).

## 0.5.0 - 07-17-2024

#### Added

* Add support for `meta` and `parameter_meta` sections in struct definitions in
  WDL 1.2 ([#127](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/127)).
* Add support for omitting `input` keyword in call statement bodies in WDL 1.2
  ([#125](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/125)).
* Add support for the `Directory` type in WDL 1.2 ([#124](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/124)).
* Add support for multi-line strings in WDL 1.2 ([#123](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/123)).

* Add support for `requirements` sections in WDL 1.2 ([#117](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/117)).
* Add support for the exponentiation operator in WDL 1.2 ([#111](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/111)).

#### Changed

* Removed `Send` and `Sync` constraints from the `Visitor` trait
  ([#128](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/128)).

* The `Type` enumeration, and friends, in `wdl-ast` no longer implement
  `PartialOrd`  and `Ord`; those implementations have moved to the sort lint
  rule ([#110](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/110)).
* The `PartialEq` implementation of the `Type` enumeration, and friends, is now
  implemented in terms of WDL type equivalence and not by CST node equivalence

## 0.4.0 - 06-28-2024

#### Added

* Added a method to `ImportStatement` for deriving the namespace from the
  import URI ([#91](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/91)).

  label ([#85](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/85)).

#### Changed

* Refactored the `Visitor` trait and validation visitors so that they are not
  in a `v1` module ([#95](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/95)).

## 0.3.0 - 06-13-2024

#### Fixed

* Fixed the experimental parser validation to check negative numbers in
  metadata sections ([#66](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/66)).

#### Added

* Added `parent` method to section representations in the experimental AST
  ([#70](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/70)).
* Added validation rules for the experimental AST ([#65](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/65)).
* Added a new experimental AST for the experimental parser; this implementation
  is currently feature-gated behind the `experimental` feature ([#64](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/64)).

#### Changed

* Removed the old AST implementation in favor of new new parser; this also
  removes the `experimental` feature from the crate ([#79](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/79)).
* Removed dependency on `miette` and `thiserror` in the experimental parser,
  re-exported key items from `wdl-grammar`'s experimental parser implementation,
