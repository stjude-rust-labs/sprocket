## Unreleased

## 0.4.0 - 06-13-2024

### Fixed

* Fixed the experimental parser validation to check negative numbers in
  metadata sections ([#66](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/66)).

### Added

* Added `parent` method to section representations in the experimental AST
  ([#70](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/70)).
* Added validation rules for the experimental AST ([#65](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/65)).
* Added a new experimental AST for the experimental parser; this implementation
  is currently feature-gated behind the `experimental` feature ([#64](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/64)).

### Changed

* Removed the old AST implementation in favor of new new parser; this also 
  removes the `experimental` feature from the crate ([#79](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/79)).
* Removed dependency on `miette` and `thiserror` in the experimental parser,
  re-exported key items from `wdl-grammar`'s experimental parser implementation,
  and changed errors to use `Diagnostic` ([#68](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/68)).
