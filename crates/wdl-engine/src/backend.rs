/// Determines the longest range in a slice where the sum of the weights of the
/// elements in the returned range is less than or equal to the supplied total
/// weight.
///
/// The returned range always starts at zero as this algorithm will partially
/// sort the slice.
///
/// Due to the partial sorting, the provided slice will have its elements
/// rearranged. As the function modifies the slice in-place, this function does
/// not make any allocations.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// This function is implemented using a modified quick sort algorithm as a
/// solution to the more general "0/1 knapsack" problem where each item has an
/// equal profit value; this maximizes for the number of items to put
/// into the knapsack (i.e. longest range that fits).
///
/// Using a uniform random pivot point, it partitions the input into two sides:
/// the left side where all weights are less than the pivot and the right side
/// where all weights are equal to or greater than the pivot.
///
/// It then checks to see if the total weight of the left side is less than or
/// equal to the total remaining weight; if it is, every element in
/// the left side is considered as part of the output and it recurses on the
/// right side.
///
/// If the total weight of the left side is greater than the remaining weight
/// budget, it can completely ignore the right side and instead recurse on the
/// left side.
///
/// The algorithm stops when the partition size reaches zero.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the supplied weight is a negative value.
