## Unreleased

#### Added

* Added the `split` standard library function in preparation for WDL v1.3 ([#424](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/424)).
* Added support for `else if` and `else` clauses in conditional statements (in support of WDL v1.3) ([#411](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/411)).
* Added shell expansion to the `apptainer_images_dir` config option, though this is an interim workaround for HPC path awkwardness pending the removal of this option entirely in the future ([#435](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/435)).
* Added experimental Slurm + Apptainer backend ([#436](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/436)).
* Introduced pre-evaluation task type for all pre-evaluation contexts (task requirements, task hints, and task runtime sections) and expanded support of `task.previous` for post-evaluation sections in WDL v1.3 ([#432](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/432)).
* Added GPU support to the Docker backend ([#439](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/439)).

#### Changed

* Added optional CPU and memory limits to the queue definitions in the LSF + Apptainer backend configuration. This is a breaking change for previous LSF configurations, as the queues are now a struct with a required `name` string field, rather than just a bare string ([#429](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/429)).

#### Fixed

* Improved the portability of generated Apptainer scripts ([#442](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/442)).

* Added `retries` configuration setting for the TES backend ([#408](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/408)).
* Added support for passing `None` for non-optional inputs with default
  expressions in WDL 1.2 call statements ([#356](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/356)).

  URLs ([#416](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/416)).

  the cache ([#393](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/pull/393)).

* Removed evaluation progress callbacks in favor of Crankshaft events channel ([#583](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/583)).

#### Fixed

* Use `IndexMap` for stable serialization of `Config` ([#602](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl/pull/602)).
