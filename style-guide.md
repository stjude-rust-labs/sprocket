# WDL Style Guide

The below rules will all be added as lints to `sprocket`. At the time of writing (December 2023), we consider all rules herein to be up for debate. Please open an issue on this repository if you would like to suggest changes to this document.

## Rules

- Files should have an [SPDX formatted](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/using-SPDX-short-identifiers-in-source-files/) Copyright and License information at the top of the page, but below any `wdldoc` header lines (lines starting with `##`)
  - If copyright and license comments are preceeded by `wdldoc` header lines, there should be an empty comment line (`#\n`) between them
- The WDL version declaration should immediately follow copyright and license comments, without any lines separating them
- All import statements should follow the WDL version declaration (with one empty line between the version and the first import statement)
- Import statements should be sorted by the lexicographical ordering of each line
  - No extra white space allowed between symbols or lines
- There should be a blank line between each WDL element (such as the import block and any task/workflow definitions)
- Variables, tasks, and workflows should be in lowercase "snake_case"
- Declared structs should be in "PascalCase"
- For workflows, the following sections must be present and in this order: `meta`, `parameter_meta`, `input`, `output`
- For tasks, the following sections must be present and in this order: `meta`, `parameter_meta`, `input`, `command`, `output`, `runtime`
- The `meta` section should have a `description` of the task or workflow
  - The `description` should be in active voice, beginning the first sentence with a verb
    - Each task/workflow is _doing_ something. The first sentence should be a succinct description of what that "something" is.
- The `meta` section should have an `outputs` key and keys with descriptions for each output of the task/workflow
- Additional `meta` entries are allowed (such as `author` or `email` keys)
- All inputs must have a corresponding `parameter_meta` entry
  - Inputs and parameter meta must be in the same order
  - 3 high level input sections
    - first are required inputs
    - second are optional inputs
    - last are inputs with a default value
  - within each section, inputs are ordered by variable type
    - `File`
    - `Array[*]+`
    - `Array[*]`
    - `struct`
    - `Object`
    - `Map[*, *]`
    - `Pair[*, *]`
    - `String`
    - `Boolean`
    - `Float`
    - `Int`
  - for ordering of the same compound type, drop the outermost type and recursively apply above sorting
  - once the above ordering is satisfied, it is up to the developer for final order of inputs of the same type.
- No local file paths are allowed to be assigned to a `File` type
  - Local file paths should only be supplied at the time of execution, _NOT_ at the time of definition
- Disallowed input names: `/^[iI]n[A-Z_]/`, `/^input/i`
  - It is redundant and needlessly verbose to use an input's name to specify that it is an input
- If documenting a workflow, task, input, or output and you need to be more verbose than is appropriate in a `description:` field, you may include _in addition_ an `external_help:` key with a URL
  - `external_help` is _not_ a substitute for internal documentation, although it may allow the internal documentation to be briefer
- `command` blocks should be wrapped with arrows (`<<< >>>`) instead of brackets (`{ }`)
  - Certain Bash constructions cause problems with the bracket notation
- output variable names should be short but descriptive
  - Disallowed output names: `/^[oO]ut[A-Z_]/`, `/^output/i`, `/^..?$/`
    - It is redundant and needlessly verbose to use an output's name to specify that it is an output
- All tasks must run in a persistently versioned `container` with an `sha sum`
  - This ensures reproducibility across time and environments
- `cpu`, `memory` and `disk` values are all required in the `runtime` section of a task
- The runtime section should be ordered in the following way:
  - `cpu`
  - `memory`
  - `disk`
  - `container`
  - `maxRetries`
- Use double quotes whenever possible
- All comma delimited WDL objects should have a trailing comma
- There may be at most two WDL elements present on a single line of a meta section
  - If two elements are on the same line, they must be a _complete_ key-value pair
  - If a key-value pair consists of more than 2 elements, than _each element_ should be on it's own line
- no whitespace on empty lines
- no whitespace at the end of lines
- indentation should be 4 spaces and never tab literals
- At most one empty line in a row
- There should be an empty line between workflow/task sections and any intermediate declarations
- End the file with a newline
- Comments on the same line as code should have 2 spaces before the `#` and one space before the comment
- Files should not mix `\n` and `\r\n` line breaks
- WDL lines should be less than 90 characters wide whenever possible
  - Exceptions would be long strings that WDL doesn't allow to be broken up
  - This restriction applies to embedded code in the `command` block as well.
- Any tasks which are deprecated should have a `deprecated: true` key in their `meta` section
  - It is allowed (but redundant and discouraged) to include a `deprecated: false` key in any production tasks. All tasks are assumed to not be deprecated unless otherwise noted.
  - In addition, the `description` key of deprecated tasks should start with `**[DEPRECATED]**`
    - These two rules allow for a task's deprecated status to be communicated in multiple ways, ensuring no user misses the notice
- Deprecated tasks should be placed at the end of their file
