ContainerUri [Clarity, Portability]
Ensures that values for the `container` key within `runtime`/`requirements` sections are well-formed.

This rule checks the following:

        - Containers should have a tag, as container URIs with no tags have no expectation that the behavior of the containers won't change between runs.
        - Further, immutable containers tagged with SHA256 sums are preferred. This is due to the requirement from the WDL specification that tasks produce functionally equivalent output across runs. When a mutable tag is used, there is a risk that changes to the container will cause different behavior between runs.
        - Use of the 'any' container URI (`*`) within an array of container URIs is ambiguous and should be avoided.
        - Empty container URI arrays are not disallowed by the specification but are ambiguous and should be avoided.
        - An array of container URIs with a single element should be changed to a single string value.
