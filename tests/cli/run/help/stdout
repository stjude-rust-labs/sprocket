Runs a task or workflow

Usage: sprocket run [OPTIONS] <PATH or URL> [INPUTS]...

Arguments:
  <PATH or URL>
          A source WDL file or URL

  [INPUTS]...
          The inputs for the task or workflow.
          
          These inputs can be either paths to files containing inputs or key-value pairs passed in on the command line.

Options:
  -e, --entrypoint <NAME>
          The name of the task or workflow to run.
          
          This argument is required if trying to run a task or workflow without any inputs.
          
          If `entrypoint` is not specified, all inputs (from both files and key-value pairs) are expected to be prefixed with the name of the workflow or task being run.
          
          If `entrypoint` is specified, it will be appended with a `.` delimiter and then prepended to all key-value pair inputs on the command line. Keys specified within files are unchanged by this argument.

  -o, --output <OUTPUT_DIR>
          The execution output directory; defaults to the task name if provided, otherwise, `output`

      --overwrite
          Overwrites the execution output directory if it exists

      --no-color
          Disables color output

  -m, --report-mode <MODE>
          The report mode

          Possible values:
          - full:     Prints diagnostics as multiple lines
          - one-line: Prints diagnostics as one line

  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity

  -q, --quiet...
          Decrease logging verbosity

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
