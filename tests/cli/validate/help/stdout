Validate a set of inputs against a task or workflow.

This ensures that every required input is supplied, every supplied input is correctly typed, that no extraneous inputs are provided, and that any provided `File` or `Directory` inputs exist.

It will not catch potential runtime errors that may occur when running the task or workflow.

Usage: sprocket validate [OPTIONS] <SOURCE> [INPUTS]...

Arguments:
  <SOURCE>
          The path or URL to a document containing the task or workflow to validate inputs against

  [INPUTS]...
          The inputs for the task or workflow.
          
          These inputs can be either paths to files containing inputs or key-value pairs passed in on the command line.

Options:
  -e, --entrypoint <NAME>
          The name of the task or workflow to validate inputs against.
          
          This argument is required if trying to validate a task or workflow without any inputs.
          
          If `entrypoint` is not specified, all inputs (from both files and key-value pairs) are expected to be prefixed with the name of the workflow or task being run.
          
          If `entrypoint` is specified, it will be appended with a `.` delimiter and then prepended to all key-value pair inputs on the command line. Keys specified within files are unchanged by this argument.

      --no-color
          Disables color output

  -m, --report-mode <MODE>
          The report mode

          Possible values:
          - full:     Prints diagnostics as multiple lines
          - one-line: Prints diagnostics as one line

  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity

  -q, --quiet...
          Decrease logging verbosity

  -c, --config <CONFIG>
          Path to the configuration file

  -s, --skip-config-search
          Skip searching for and loading configuration files.
          
          Only a configuration file specified as a command line argument will be used.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
