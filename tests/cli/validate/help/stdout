Validate a set of inputs against a task or workflow.

This ensures that every required input is supplied, every supplied input is correctly typed, that no extraneous inputs are provided, and that any provided `File` or `Directory` inputs exist.

It will not catch potential runtime errors that may occur when running the task or workflow.

Usage: sprocket validate [OPTIONS] <SOURCE> [INPUTS]...

Arguments:
  <SOURCE>
          The path or URL to a document containing the task or workflow to validate inputs against

  [INPUTS]...
          The inputs for the task or workflow.
          
          These inputs can be either paths to files containing inputs or key-value pairs passed in on the command line.

Options:
  -t, --target <NAME>
          The name of the task or workflow to validate inputs against.
          
          This argument is required if trying to validate a task or workflow without any inputs.
          
          If `target` is not specified, all inputs (from both files and key-value pairs) are expected to be prefixed with the name of the workflow or task being run.
          
          If `target` is specified, it will be appended with a `.` delimiter and then prepended to all key-value pair inputs on the command line. Keys specified within files are unchanged by this argument.

  -m, --report-mode <MODE>
