Validate a set of inputs against a task or workflow.

This ensures that every required input is supplied, every supplied input is correctly typed, that no extraneous inputs are provided, and that any provided `File` or `Directory` inputs exist.

It will not catch potential runtime errors that may occur when running the task or workflow.

Usage: sprocket validate [OPTIONS] <PATH or URL> [INPUTS]...

Arguments:
  <PATH or URL>
          The path or URL to a document containing the task or workflow to validate inputs against

  [INPUTS]...
          The inputs for the task or workflow.
          
          These inputs can be either paths to files containing inputs or key-value pairs passed in on the command line.

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>
          The name of the task or workflow to validate inputs against.
          
          If inputs are provided, this will be attempted to be inferred from the prefixed names of the inputs (e.g, `<name>.<input-name>`).
          
          If no inputs are provided and this argument is not provided, it will be assumed you're trying to validate the workflow present in the specified document.
